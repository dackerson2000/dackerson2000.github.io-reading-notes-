## D'Angelo Ackerson's Reading Notes

* Growth Mindset **in my own words** means to **always** have the **inside urge to work on yourself in all aspects of life.**

### Reminders

* Only **I** can obtain *my* ideal lifestyle

* **I** can't depend on nobody to make my situation better

* Take care of my people.
